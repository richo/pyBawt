This code will become the new trunk soon.

I see no reason to maintain the legacy crap.

TODO
----

Flesh out the API to let it do everything

More verbose admin commands

Handler for adding modules to other channels

Handler for telling the bot what to do

BUG: python2.6 won't create an args module which breaks the auto restart code

RADIO!!
-------

Infrastructure for retrieving ops

Decide how ircd/network agnostic I want this bot. I'm hoping to keep everything psych0tik agnostic in the modules.d structure. Even then I think I need to move the core stuff out.
